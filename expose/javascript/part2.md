1. At line 12, the console will print out the number of elements in the prices array which is 3
2. At line 13, the console will print out the lastest discountedPrice value from the for loop which is 150
3. The function returns "NaN" which means Not a Number because the calculation from the  "finalPrice" gives a floating point number and the round function fails when doing arithmetic calculation with floating point number.
4. The function will return an array of discounted values that were calculated from the for loop but nothing output on the console.
5. The code causes an error which is "discountPrices is not defined" because "let" only lets you use the variables and the function within the scope of the function. Thus, the code returns error.
6. The code causes an error which is "discountPrices is not defined" because "let" only lets you use the variables and the function within the scope of the function. Thus, the code returns error.
7. The code return NaN because the round function got an error from doing arithmetic calculation with floating point number.
8. The code return an array of "NaN" due to the failure of the finalPrice calculation.
9. At line 11, the code causes an error because "let" only lets you use the variables and the function within the scope of the function. Thus, the code returns error.
10. At line 12, the function printed out "3" which the length of the array.
11. The function will return a "discounted" array where it stores the discountedPriced but nothing will appear on the console.

    A. student.name;

    A. '32' - since integers map to their exact string representation
    B. 1 - since Javascript is able to detect data type so it does a algebra subtraction on 2 integers.
    C. 3 - because Javascript consider null as 0
    D. '3null' - because Javascript detects "3" as a string so that it also detect "null" as a string as well, thus, it concatinated the 2 strings together
    E. 4 - since true maps to 1
    F. 0 - since false maps to 0 and null is also considered as 0
    G. '3undefined' - because Javascript detects "3" as a string so that it also detects "undefined" as a string as well, thus, it concatinated the 2 strings together.
    H. NaN - When a number is undefined, it takes everything else with it. It canâ€™t be used in an equation or formula
14. TBC
    A. true - because Javascript converts string '2' to integer
    B. false - when compare 2 strings, Javascript compares them in lexicographical order, that's why it returns false
    C. true - because Javascript converts string '2' to integer
    D. false - because strict equality operator checks the equality without type conversion and an integer is different from a string. Thus, it returns false.
    E. false - Javascript convert true to 1 as an integer and 1 is smaller than 2. Thus, it returns false
    F. true - because boolean of 2 will return true, and true is equal to true
15. The == operator does the data type conversion of the operands before comparison, and the === operator compares the values as well as the data types of the operands

17. The modifyArray([1,2,3], doSomething) returned [2, 4, 6]. The modifyArray([1,2,3], doSomething) take in an array of [1, 2, 3] and a doSomething function which multiply the value of the array by 2.
